### **Scenario: Launching "TechTrove" - A Beacon in E-commerce**

In the bustling metropolis of the digital marketplace, the need for distinct and efficient e-commerce platforms is more vital than ever. As we stand at the cusp of this digital revolution, our ambitious project, "TechTrove", is preparing to make its mark.

**Backdrop**: Over the past decade, online shopping has shifted from a novelty to a necessity. With an increasing number of consumers favoring the convenience of online shopping over traditional methods, there's a continual need to advance and refine the digital shopping experience.

**TechTrove's Mission**: "TechTrove" isn't aiming to be just another name in the crowded e-commerce space. We envision it as a treasure trove for tech enthusiasts, where they can discover the latest gadgets, software solutions, and innovations. With a focus on curated content, seamless user interface, and community-driven reviews, we aim to create an unparalleled shopping experience for our users.

**The Challenge**: While a sleek and intuitive frontend is crucial for user engagement, the real machinery that powers an e-commerce giant like "TechTrove" is its backend. This backend isn't just about storing data; it's the nerve center that brings our vision to life. It's about creating a dynamic environment where products are updated in real-time, orders are processed efficiently, and every user interaction is personalized and seamless.

**The Keystone**: Central to our backend operations is the development of a robust microservice. This isn't just any microservice; it's the linchpin that manages three core pillars of our platform:

1. **Products**: From latest VR headsets to groundbreaking AI software, this service will handle an ever-evolving catalog of tech products.
2. **Orders**: Every click on the 'Buy Now' button sends ripples through our system, initiating a series of processes that ensure the product reaches the user's doorstep. This service ensures that every order, be it one or a thousand, is processed with the same efficiency.
3. **User Interactions**: The essence of "TechTrove" lies in its community. This service will manage user profiles, reviews, ratings, and other interactions, ensuring that our users aren't just shoppers but contributors to the "TechTrove" ecosystem.

**How to run each microservice:**

`./gralew bootRun` 

Is importat to mention that to run database services is required use docker images for MongoDB and MySQL.

`docker pull mongo`

`$ docker run --name some-mongo -d mongo:tag`

`docker pull mysql`

`docker run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql -d mysql:tag`
